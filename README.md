## About the app

This is a prototype of a training application, used to demonstrate how to make a prototype using AngularJS. It demonstrates mocking out backend in the services with http requests to JSONs and session storage.

## Requirements

To run the app, you must have node and npm installed. To build the app, you'll need grunt and sass as well.

## Running the app

To run the app, simply run the command `npm start`. This will run a npm install of other dependant libraries. Depending on your system, you may need to run `sudo npm start`.

When the app is finished installing dependencies, it will start a local web server. Browse to `http://localhost:8000/app/index-dev.html`
